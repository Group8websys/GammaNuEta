For this lab, I was in charge of creating the tutoring signup sheet and an events page. 

I first looked at the overall style of my groupmates pages to try to model my css to fit theirs.

For the signup page, I made a similar signup page for last weeks lab, which drew inspiration from www3schools and stackoverflow. I decided to have the form to the left and the GNH logo to the right. I had a lot of trouble lining everything up correctly, as I wasn't sure which div to insert the image into and how to split up the page. I searched it up, and decided to set the width of my form to a percentage of the page with a fixed absolute css to the left to a certain percentage, and my image also fixed absulte to the left with a percentage. 

For the activities page, I decided to gain a little more information about the company expose and tutoring by emailing Andrew, who sent me a powerpoint of the slides. I read through it and added some extra tidbits that I found besides the original lab description.
I decided to create two divs, one for each activity. I was having trouble with overlap, so I looked it up on stackoverflow and found that using z-index can help me solve that problem.

The navigaton bar was created by one of my team members, and uses ajax.
