          <h1>Company Expose</h1>
          <p>The Company Expose is the largest ITWS recruitment event, featureing students and recruiters engaging in casual games and activities as a way to "break the ice".</p>
          <p>Some of these activities include Two Truths and a Lie, Pancakes vs Waffles, and Never Have I Ever.</p>
          <p>Once the planned activities are completed, students have time to chat one-on-one with recruiters and network.</p>
